#### Definition
    - A proxy is an object that controls access to another object.
    - almost similar to decorator, only difference Proxy may or maynot delegate, while decorator always.
#### Intent
    - Control access to an Object
    - includes:
        - When to create it (lazy or not)
        - whether to allow access 
        - whether to cache
        - whether to forward at all
#### Types
    - Virtual Proxy (lazy loading)
        - Delay creation of heavy objects until it's actually needed.
            - Large images, file / DB entities (Hibernate lazy loading) / Expensive initialization
    - Protection Proxy (Access Control)
        - control who can access the object.
            - authorization , role-based access, security checks.
    - Caching Proxy 
        - Proxy decides WHETHER to call real object again.
        - Avoid repeating expensive operations by caching results.
            - DB Calls / API Calls / Computation-heavy methods.
    - Remote Proxy
        - Represent an object that lives in a different process/machine.
        - local-looking object, remote execution.
        - RPC / REST Clients / gRPC
    - Logging / Monitoring Proxy
        - looks like decorator but intent is control / observation.
        - Add observability without changing the object
            - logging / metrics / tracing
    - Smart Proxy ( Resource Management)
        - Do extra work before/after access.
            - Reference Counting / Thread safety / resource locking.
